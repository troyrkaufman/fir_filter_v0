# Decimation by 8 FIR filter

## Progress Update

* Built selfchecking testbench for design

* Built behavioral model of decimation by 8 FIR filter and compared this expected value to my design's output

* The signs are the same, but the magnitudes differ by a bit. There is an error that ranges between 0.1 to 1.5%.
